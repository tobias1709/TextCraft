                                - Added extra mobs per zone, so you can encounter different types in each zone now.

                            <p>
                                - Implemented experiance gained decay on mobs, so you won't get any experiance points when you kill
                                a mob 6 levels lower than you, and you will receive a lowered amount of experiance points when 
                                you kill a mob 4 levels under you.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                - Mage have been added as a pickable class now, only with 2 spells like the other classes though. 
                                My plan is to get hunter working with 2 spells as well and then i will add the remaining spells and see if i can balance them properly. Mage seems to overscale a bit much, which I will work on now.

                                - Warrior have gotten a cooldown on mortal strike which lasts for 3 rounds. (Working on a way to display the cooldown).

                                - Implemented chat system and leaderboard function (currently working on the database connection).

                                - The game has gotten a new domain and therefor i am also trying to figure out a way to transfer the
