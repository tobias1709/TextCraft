                                - Implemented experiance gained decay on mobs, so you won't get any experiance points when you kill
                                a mob 6 levels lower than you, and you will receive a lowered amount of experiance points when 
                                you kill a mob 4 levels under you.

                                - Mage have been added as a pickable class now, only with 2 spells like the other classes though. 
                                My plan is to get hunter working with 2 spells as well and then i will add the remaining spells and see if i can balance them properly. Mage seems to overscale a bit much, which I will work on now.
